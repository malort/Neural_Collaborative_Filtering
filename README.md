# Neural_Collaborative_Filtering

## Introduction:

Neural Collaborative filtering is a Deep Learning based solution that uses the flexibility, complexity, and non-linearity of Neural Networks to build a recommender system.

## Data:

The dataset contains a set of movie ratings from the MovieLens website, a movie recommendation service.

## Requirements:

```pandas:``` Data analysis and manipulation tool.

```Numpy:``` Numerical analysis library.

```scikit-learn:``` Machine Learning library.

```string:``` Common string operations module.

```re:``` This module provides regular expression matching operations.

```keras:``` Open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library
